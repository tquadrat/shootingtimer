A tool that helps with shooting training.

Currently, the [provided Tar file](https://tquadrat.githup.io/shootingtimer/build/distributions/org.tquadrat.shootingtime-0.3.0,tar) works for x64 Linux only. The provided Zip file is intended for Windows, but is does not work on that platform.

I need to create builds for all platforms (Linux x64, Raspberry PI and Windows), but this is work in progress.
